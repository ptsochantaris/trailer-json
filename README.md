# TrailerJson

A feather-weight JSON decoder in Swift with no dependencies. Is is roughly based on a version of Swift.org's open source replacement for the Apple JSONSerialisation framework.

It is currently used in [Trailer](https://github.com/ptsochantaris/trailer) and [Trailer-CLI](https://github.com/ptsochantaris/trailer-cli) and has been heavily tested and used in production with GitHub JSON v3 and v4 API payloads.

#### Compared to JSONSerialisation (when running optimised)
It performs almost equivalently _BUT!_ the results are all native Swift types, so using those results incurs no bridging or copying costs, which is a major performance bonus.

#### Compared to Swift.org's version
Because it heavily trades features for decode-only performance, and that it returns native Swift types without the need to bridge them to ObjC for compatibility, it is by definition faster than the Swift.org version.

#### TL;DR

üëç Ideal for parsing stable and known service API responses like GraphQL, or on embedded devices. Self contained with no setup overhead.

üëé Bad at parsing/verifying potentially broken JSON, APIs which may suddenly include unexpected schema entries, or when you're better served by `Decodable` types.

#### Examples
```
        let url = URL(string: "http://date.jsontest.com")!
        let data = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url).0
        
        if let json = try data.asJsonObject(),
           let timeString = json["time"] as? String {
           
            print("The time is", timeString)
        }
```

TrailerJson works directly with raw bytes so it can accept data from any type that exposes a raw byte buffer, such as NIO's ByteBuffer, without expensive casting or copies in-between:

```
        let byteBuffer: ByteBuffer = ...
        let jsonDictionary = try byteBuffer.withVeryUnsafeBytes { 
            try TrailerJson.parse(bytes: $0) as? [String: Any]
        }
```

#### Notes
- Supports UTF8 JSON data only
- Uses native Swift data types in the results, no bridging overheads
- null objects, fields, or array entries are thrown away, they are not kept
- Floating point numbers are parsed as Float (i.e. not Double)
- Does not support exponent numbers, only integers and floats
- Does little to error-correct if the JSON feed isn't to spec
